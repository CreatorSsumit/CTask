main branch -  features added :-

1) admin can delete user
2) admin can change permissions
3) fix crashes during login and signup like network crashes errors

client server is running on localhost:3000;
and server is running on localhost:4000;


I used mongodb for database;

admin login = {

username:pksumitkumar98@gmail.com,
password:12


}

To create new admin  just go to ' http://localhost:3000/registeradmin ' route;


To run server and client both simultaneously , so just run commands in capgemini_task folder =  yarn start or npm start;


if sometimes  you may face stuck problem during login or register or i have a account button does'nt work in userpage so register fake candidiate and submit it then go to login page by clicking i have a account button.
